        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.</span> Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.</span> And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4.</span> And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5.</span> And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6.</span> So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7.</span> And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.</span> But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9.</span> And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padan-aram, and blessed him.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10.</span> And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11.</span> And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12.</span> And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13.</span> And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14.</span> And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15.</span> And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16.</span> And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17.</span> And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18.</span> And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died,) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19.</span> And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20.</span> And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21.</span> And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22.</span> And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23.</span> The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24.</span> The sons of Rachel; Joseph and Benjamin:</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25.</span> And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan and Naphtali:</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26.</span> And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padan-aram.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27.</span> And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28.</span> And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29.</span> And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.</div>
