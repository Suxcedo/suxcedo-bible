    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1.</span> The Lord had said to Abram, "Go from your country, your people and your father’s household to the land I will show you.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.</span> "I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.</span> I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you."</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4.</span> So Abram went, as the Lord had told him; and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he set out from Harran.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5.</span> He took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all the possessions they had accumulated and the people they had acquired in Harran, and they set out for the land of Canaan, and they arrived there.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6.</span> Abram traveled through the land as far as the site of the great tree of Moreh at Shechem. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7.</span> The Lord appeared to Abram and said, "To your offspring I will give this land." So he built an altar there to the Lord, who had appeared to him.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.</span> From there he went on toward the hills east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to the Lord and called on the name of the Lord.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9.</span> Then Abram set out and continued toward the Negev.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10.</span> Now there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while because the famine was severe.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11.</span> As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, "I know what a beautiful woman you are.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12.</span> When the Egyptians see you, they will say, 'This is his wife.' Then they will kill me but will let you live.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13.</span> Say you are my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of you."</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14.</span> When Abram came to Egypt, the Egyptians saw that Sarai was a very beautiful woman.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15.</span> And when Pharaoh’s officials saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into his palace.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16.</span> He treated Abram well for her sake, and Abram acquired sheep and cattle, male and female donkeys, male and female servants, and camels.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17.</span> But the Lord inflicted serious diseases on Pharaoh and his household because of Abram’s wife Sarai.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18.</span> So Pharaoh summoned Abram. "What have you done to me?" he said. "Why didn’t you tell me she was your wife?</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19.</span> Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her to be my wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take her and go!"</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20.</span> Then Pharaoh gave orders about Abram to his men, and they sent him on his way, with his wife and everything he had.</div>
