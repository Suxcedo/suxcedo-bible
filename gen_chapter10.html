    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1.</span> This is the account of Shem, Ham and Japheth, Noah’s sons, who themselves had sons after the flood.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.</span> The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshek and Tiras.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.</span> The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath and Togarmah.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4.</span> The sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, the Kittites and the Rodanites.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5.</span> (From these the maritime peoples spread out into their territories by their clans within their nations, each with its own language.)</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6.</span> The sons of Ham: Cush, Egypt, Put and Canaan.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7.</span> The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah and Sabteka. The sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.</span> Cush was the father of Nimrod, who became a mighty warrior on the earth.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9.</span> He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; that is why it is said, “Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the LORD.”</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10.</span> The first centers of his kingdom were Babylon, Uruk, Akkad and Kalneh, in Shinar.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11.</span> From that land he went to Assyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12.</span> and Resen, which is between Nineveh and Calah—which is the great city.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13.</span> Egypt was the father of the Ludites, Anamites, Lehabites, Naphtuhites,</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14.</span> Pathrusites, Kasluhites (from whom the Philistines came) and Caphtorites.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15.</span> Canaan was the father of Sidon his firstborn, and of the Hittites,</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16.</span> Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites,</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17.</span> Hivites, Arkites, Sinites,</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18.</span> Arvadites, Zemarites and Hamathites. Later the Canaanite clans scattered</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19.</span> and the borders of Canaan reached from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboyim, as far as Lasha.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20.</span> These are the sons of Ham by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21.</span> Sons were also born to Shem, whose older brother was Japheth; Shem was the ancestor of all the sons of Eber.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22.</span> The sons of Shem: Elam, Ashur, Arphaxad, Lud and Aram.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23.</span> The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether and Meshek.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24.</span> Arphaxad was the father of Shelah, and Shelah the father of Eber.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25.</span> Two sons were born to Eber: One was named Peleg, because in his time the earth was divided; his brother was named Joktan.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26.</span> Joktan was the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27.</span> Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28.</span> Obal, Abimael, Sheba,</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29.</span> Ophir, Havilah and Jobab. All these were sons of Joktan.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30.</span> The region where they lived stretched from Mesha toward Sephar, in the eastern hill country.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31.</span> These are the sons of Shem by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32.</span> These are the clans of Noah’s sons, according to their lines of descent, within their nations. From these the nations spread out over the earth after the flood.</div>
