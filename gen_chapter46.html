        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.</span> And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.</span> And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4.</span> I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5.</span> And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.</div>

        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27.</span> And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28.</span> And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29.</span> And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30.</span> And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31.</span> And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up and show Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32.</span> And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33.</span> And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?</div>
        <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34.</span> That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.</div>
