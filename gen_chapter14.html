      <h3>KJV</h3>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1.</span> In the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of Goiim,</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.</span> these kings went to war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboyim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar).</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.</span> All these latter kings joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Dead Sea).</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4.</span> Twelve years they had been subject to Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5.</span> In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings allied with him went out and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim,</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6.</span> the Horites in their hill country of Seir as far as El Paran near the desert,</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7.</span> and the Amalekites in Hazezon Tamar.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.</span> Then they turned back and went to En Mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and they conquered the whole territory of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who were living in Hazezon Tamar.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9.</span> The kings of Sodom and Gomorrah, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboyim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) came out and joined forces in the Valley of Siddim</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10.</span> (that is, the Dead Sea).</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11.</span> The Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits, and when the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some of them fell into these pits, and the rest fled to the hills.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12.</span> Then the enemy took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food, and went away.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13.</span> They also took Lot, Abram’s nephew, who was living in Sodom, and his possessions, since he was one of the wealthiest men living there.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14.</span> When Abram heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15.</span> During the night Abram divided his forces and defeated them, pursuing them as far as Hobah, north of Damascus.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16.</span> He recovered all the goods and brought back his relative Lot and his possessions, together with the women and the other people.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17.</span> After Abram returned from defeating Chedorlaomer and the kings allied with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley).</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18.</span> Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High,</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19.</span> and he blessed Abram, saying, “Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20.</span> And praise be to God Most High, who delivered your enemies into your hand.” Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21.</span> The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people and keep the goods for yourself.”</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22.</span> But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “With raised hand I have sworn an oath to the LORD, God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth,</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23.</span> that I will accept nothing belonging to you, not even a thread or the strap of a sandal, so that you will never be able to say, ‘I made Abram rich.’</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24.</span> I will accept nothing but what my men have eaten and the share that belongs to the men who went with me—to Aner, Eshcol and Mamre. Let them have their share.”</div>
