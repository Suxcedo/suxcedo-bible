        <div class="verse">
            <span class="verse-number">23.</span> Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.
        </div>
        <div class="verse">

            <span class="verse-number">26.</span> And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.

        <div class="verse">
            <span class="verse-number">27.</span> And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            <span class="verse-number">28.</span> And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.

            <span class="verse-number">29.</span> And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            <span class="verse-number">30.</span> And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.

        <div class="verse">
            <span class="verse-number">31.</span> Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them.

        <div class="verse">
            <span class="verse-number">32.</span> Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            <span class="verse-number">33.</span> And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the Lord, the everlasting God.
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            <span class="verse-number">34.</span> And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.
