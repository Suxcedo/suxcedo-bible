  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1.</span> And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.</span> Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.</span> Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4.</span> Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5.</span> Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6.</span> O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7.</span> Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.</span> Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9.</span> Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10.</span> The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11.</span> Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12.</span> His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13.</span> Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14.</span> Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15.</span> And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16.</span> Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17.</span> Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18.</span> I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19.</span> Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20.</span> Out of him shall come down myriads of people; and he shall be shepherd of the people, and shall be at their heels in glory.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21.</span> Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22.</span> Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall:</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23.</span> The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24.</span> But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25.</span> Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26.</span> The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27.</span> Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28.</span> All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29.</span> And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30.</span> In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31.</span> There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah;</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32.</span> The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth.</div>
