    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1.</span> Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.</span> And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.</span> And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4.</span> And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5.</span> And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6.</span> But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7.</span> And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.</span> Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9.</span> And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10.</span> The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11.</span> And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12.</span> Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13.</span> And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14.</span> And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15.</span> Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16.</span> These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17.</span> And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost, and died; and was gathered unto his people.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18.</span> And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19.</span> And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20.</span> And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21.</span> And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22.</span> And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23.</span> And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24.</span> And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25.</span> And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26.</span> And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27.</span> And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28.</span> And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29.</span> And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30.</span> And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31.</span> And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32.</span> And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33.</span> And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34.</span> Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.</div>
