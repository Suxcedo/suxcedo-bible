    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1.</span> So Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the Negev.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.</span> Abram had become very wealthy in livestock and silver and gold.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.</span> From the Negev he went from place to place until he came to Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had been earlier</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4.</span> and where he had first built an altar to the LORD. There Abram called on the name of the LORD.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5.</span> Now Lot, who was moving about with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents,</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6.</span> but the land could not support them while they stayed together, for their possessions were so great that they were not able to stay together.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7.</span> And there was strife between the herders of Abram’s livestock and the herders of Lot’s livestock, and the Canaanites and Perizzites were also living in the land at that time.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.</span> So Abram said to Lot, “Let there be no strife between you and me, or between your herders and mine, for we are close relatives.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9.</span> Is not the whole land before you? Let’s part company. If you go to the left, I’ll go to the right; if you go to the right, I’ll go to the left.”</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10.</span> Lot looked around and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan toward Zoar was well watered, like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt. (This was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.)</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11.</span> So Lot chose for himself the whole plain of the Jordan and set out toward the east. The two men parted company:</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12.</span> Abram lived in the land of Canaan, while Lot lived among the cities of the plain and pitched his tents near Sodom.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13.</span> Now the men of Sodom were wicked and were sinning greatly against the LORD.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14.</span> The LORD said to Abram after Lot had parted from him, “Look around from where you are, to the north and south, to the east and west.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15.</span> All the land that you see I will give to you and your offspring forever.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16.</span> I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust, then your offspring could be counted.</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17.</span> Go, walk through the length and breadth of the land, for I am giving it to you.”</div>
    <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18.</span> So Abram moved his tents and went to live near the great trees of Mamre at Hebron, where he built an altar to the LORD.</div>
