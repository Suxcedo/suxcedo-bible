  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1.</span> And the famine was sore in the land.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.</span> And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.</span> And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4.</span> If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5.</span> But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6.</span> And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7.</span> And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.</span> And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9.</span> I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10.</span> For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11.</span> And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12.</span> And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13.</span> Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man;</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14.</span> And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release unto you your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15.</span> And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16.</span> And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring the men into the house, and kill, and make ready; for the men shall dine with me at noon.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">17.</span> And the man did as Joseph bade: and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">18.</span> And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">19.</span> And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">20.</span> And said, O sir, we came down at the first time to buy food:</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">21.</span> And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">22.</span> And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we know not who put our money in our sacks.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">23.</span> And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">24.</span> And he brought Simeon out unto them.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">25.</span> And the steward delivered to them Joseph's merchandise; and Benjamin's portion, and asked them not for fee: because that the famine was sore upon the land.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">26.</span> And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father,</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">27.</span> And told him all that befell unto them, saying, The man, the lord of the land, spake roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">28.</span> And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">29.</span> We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">30.</span> And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men: leave one of your brethren here with me, and take ye food for the famine of your households, and be gone;</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">31.</span> And bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffic in the land.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">32.</span> And it came to pass, as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">33.</span> And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">34.</span> And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="verse-number">35.</span> And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</div>
